I have nothing to do with the making of this script I was having problems with my swww going black randomly and this script fixed it 
EDIT THE `wall=$(find ~/.config/hypr/themes/cyber/wallpaper` path to your wallpaper path :3

Script was found at : [wallpaper-changer](https://github.com/AlwaysAndrew8/wallpaper-changer)
